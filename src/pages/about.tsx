                  I advocate cloud computing and keep building ideas on the
                  cloud. Currently, I am a Senior Solutions Engineer based in
                  Munich. Before that, I was a DevOps engineer focused on AWS
                  and Kubernetes.

                  With a background in business administration and computer
                  science, I know how overwhelming when you are fresh to the
                  cloud industry. As a solution engineer, I aim to bridge the
                  gap with a solution and establish a long-term trust
                  relationship. Being a solution engineer is one of the best
                  decisions in my career so far.

                  If you don't have a tech background but want to know more

                  send me a virtual coffee invite! Happy to help!

                  We live in a world where technologies surround our day. I
                  believe tech should not look cold but comes from human nature.
                  And a proper analogy could help us to understand tech's
                  nature. Feel free to reach out to me if you would like to
                  understand any cloud computing concepts like you are only five
                  years old.
