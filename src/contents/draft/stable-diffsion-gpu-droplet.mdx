# Running Stable Diffusion on a DigitalOcean GPU Droplet

## Introduction

Stable Diffusion is a powerful AI tool for generating images, but it can be resource-heavy. Running it on a DigitalOcean GPU droplet ensures you have the computing power you need. In this guide, we’ll walk through how to set it up using the [Stable Diffusion WebUI by AUTOMATIC1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui). We’ve made it easy, so even if you're not a technical expert, don’t worry—just follow along!

## Prerequisites

- A DigitalOcean account
- A GPU Droplet (such as NVIDIA GPU)
- Basic terminal knowledge
- Installed Git and Python 3.10

## Why Use a GPU Droplet?

Stable Diffusion can run on a CPU, but it's slow. Running it on a GPU drastically improves the performance, and with DigitalOcean's offerings, you don't need the latest H100 GPU to see improvements—though that's an option if you want top-tier performance. By spinning up a GPU droplet, you can easily compare the differences between CPU and GPU rendering.

## Step 1: Set Up the GPU Droplet

1. **Create a GPU Droplet**  
   Log into your DigitalOcean account, create a new droplet, and choose a plan that includes a GPU. A basic GPU plan should suffice for image generation.

2. **Add a New User (Recommended)**  
   Instead of using the root user for everything, it’s better to create a new user for security reasons:

```bash
adduser your_username
usermod -aG sudo your_username
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Once you're logged in, update the droplet and install the necessary tools:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y wget git python3 python3-venv
```

## Step 3: Clone the Stable Diffusion Repository

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui.git
cd stable-diffusion-webui
```

## Step 4: Configure and Run Stable Diffusion

1. **Set Up a Python Virtual Environment**:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. \*\* Modifying `webui-user.sh` to Enable Public Access via Gradio and API

To ensure that you can get a public accessible link via Gradio, enable the GPU accerlation by xformers and enable the backend API, follow these steps to modify the `webui-user.sh` file.

- Open the `webui-user.sh` file using a text editor:
  ```bash
  nano webui-user.sh
  ```
- Add the following line before any other commands:

```bash
export COMMANDLINE_ARGS="--share --api --xformers"
```

- Save and close the file. In nano, this can be done by pressing CTRL + X, then typing Y to confirm, and hitting Enter.

Once this is done, Gradio will generate a public link for external access, and the backend API will also be enabled for further integrations.

3. **Run the WebUI**  
   Start the Stable Diffusion WebUI with:

```bash
./webui.sh
```

Open your browser and go to \`http://your_droplet_ip:7860` to access the interface.

### Optional: Monitor GPU Utilization with `gpustat`

If you want to monitor your GPU utilization while running Stable Diffusion, you can use a tool called `gpustat`. This tool gives you real-time information about your GPU usage, including memory, temperature, and current load.

To install and use `gpustat`, follow these steps:

1. Install `gpustat` using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install gpustat

   ```

2. After installation, you can monitor your GPU utilization by running the following command:

```bash
gpustat --color -i 1
```

## Installing a Model Using CivitAI Browser Extension

After running the `web-ui.sh` script, you may encounter an issue where the system cannot download the default model because RunwayML has removed it from the site. To ensure you can still have a model running, follow these steps to install a model through the CivitAI Browser extension:

1. Navigate to the **"Extensions"** tab in the WebUI.
2. Go to the **"Available"** sub-tab.
3. Click the orange button labeled **"Load from"** to load the available extensions from the repository.
4. In the search bar, type **"CivitAI Browser+"** and click the **Install** button.
5. Once the installation is complete, go to the **"Installed"** sub-tab.
6. Click **Apply and restart UI** to activate the extension.

   ![civitai-browser](https://res.cloudinary.com/iambigmomma/image/upload/v1685713949/blog/stable-diffusion-gpu-droplet/civitai-browser.png)

Once the WebUI restarts, you will see a new tab called **"CivitAI Browser+"**. This extension allows you to easily search for and install models directly from CivitAI.

For this demo, let’s search for **"Western Animation"** within the CivitAI Browser+ tab and install it. Choose the one with **Superman** thumbnail. We will use this model for the next part of the crash course to generate images using text-to-image (txt2img).

# Your First Gen-AI Art: Stable Diffusion Prompt Writing Tutorial

Stable Diffusion is a powerful AI image generation tool that uses positive prompts and negative prompts to guide the AI in creating specific images. This tutorial will show you how to write prompts related to marine life and how to use negative prompts to improve the quality of your images in Stable Diffusion WebUI.

### How to Write Prompts

Prompts are the core part of generating images. Positive prompts tell the AI what you want to see, while negative prompts help exclude unwanted elements. Here are examples related to marine life to show you how to write prompts.

#### 1. Writing Positive Prompts

When writing prompts, use English to describe what you want to generate. You can use simple sentences or comma-separated keywords to describe the features. Here are some marine life-related examples:

1. **Generate a sea turtle swimming over a coral reef**:

   ```text
   a sea turtle swimming over a coral reef
   ```

   Or, simplified as keywords:

   ```text
   sea turtle, swimming, coral reef, ocean
   ```

   ![sea-tutle](https://res.cloudinary.com/iambigmomma/image/upload/v1685713949/blog/stable-diffusion-gpu-droplet/sea-turtle.png)

2. **Generate a school of colorful fish**:
   ```text
   colorful fish, swimming in the ocean, school of fish, tropical fish
   ```
   ![colorful-fish-tutle](https://res.cloudinary.com/iambigmomma/image/upload/v1685713949/blog/stable-diffusion-gpu-droplet/colorful-fish.png)

#### 2. Using Negative Prompts

Negative prompts are useful for excluding unwanted elements, especially when generating multiple images. Here are some common negative prompts to avoid low-quality or incorrect results:

```text
lowres, bad anatomy, blurry, text, error, cropped, worst quality, jpeg artifacts, watermark, signature, low quality, worst quality
```

You can also add specific elements that you don't want in your marine life images, like human characters or buildings:

```text
nsfw, weapon, blood, human, car, city, building
```

### How to Use txt2image in Stable Diffusion

Stable Diffusion WebUI's txt2image feature allows you to generate images based on the prompts you write. Here's how to use it:

1. **Enter Positive and Negative Prompts**:
   In the left text box, enter the marine life-related prompts, such as:

   ```text
   colorful fish, coral reef, underwater, ocean, vibrant colors
   ```

   For the negative prompts, exclude unwanted elements:

   ```text
   lowres, bad anatomy, text, blurry, weapon, human
   ```

2. **Select Sampling Method**:
   Try "DPM++ 2M SDE Heun", or "Euler a" for sampling methods.

3. **Set Image Dimensions and Steps**:
   Set the width and height to 1024x512 and sampling steps to 20. You can also select "Restore faces" to improve details in the image, which might help even with marine life.

4. **Generate the Image**:
   Click the "Generate" button on the top right to start generating the image. Once done, you can save or adjust the image as needed.

### Common Syntax and Extensions

Stable Diffusion WebUI provides different syntaxes to improve the precision of image generation. Here are some useful ones:

- **Attention/Emphasis**: Use parentheses `( )` to emphasize certain elements in the prompt. For example, to highlight the color of a dolphin:

  ```text
  dolphin, ((blue)), ocean, swimming
  ```

  ![blue-dolphin](https://res.cloudinary.com/iambigmomma/image/upload/v1685713949/blog/stable-diffusion-gpu-droplet/blue-dolphin.png)

- **Prompt Switching**: You can switch prompts during the generation process with this syntax:
  ```text
  [shark : whale : 10] swimming in the ocean
  ```
  ![shark-whale](https://res.cloudinary.com/iambigmomma/image/upload/v1685713949/blog/stable-diffusion-gpu-droplet/shark-whale.png)

### Example Prompts

1. **Generate an octopus underwater**:

   ```text
   octopus, underwater, ocean, coral reef, vibrant colors
   ```

   Negative prompt:

   ```text
   lowres, blurry, bad anatomy, text, human
   ```

   ![octopus](https://res.cloudinary.com/iambigmomma/image/upload/v1685713949/blog/stable-diffusion-gpu-droplet/octopus.png)

2. **Generate a dolphin jumping out of the water**:

   ```text
   dolphin, jumping out of the water, ocean, sunset, splash, realistic
   ```

   Negative prompt:

   ```text
   lowres, bad anatomy, blurry, text, car, building
   ```

   ![dolphin-jump](https://res.cloudinary.com/iambigmomma/image/upload/v1685713949/blog/stable-diffusion-gpu-droplet/dolphin-jump.png)

3. **Generate a shark swimming in deep water**:
   ```text
   shark, swimming, deep ocean, dark blue water, scary, realistic
   ```
   Negative prompt:
   ```text
   lowres, bad anatomy, blurry, text, human, building
   ```
